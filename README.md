# DH2642, Interaction Programming and the Dynamic Web
## Introduction
Interaction programming gives the basic Model-View-Controller principles for developing interactive applications. These principles can be applied to many desktop, mobile or web apps frameworks. The course currently applies these principles to web applications, using JavaScript, DOM APIs, HTML, CSS etc. These front-end applications use data from remote back-ends using web APIs.°

## What was this project?
As part of this course we were told to create a website using groups of 3-4. The grousp had a couple of requirements: it has to call an api, it has to be written in a framework (React, vue, etc.), and it had to be advanced enough for the course.

With this in mind my group decided to create a program for catching, tracking, and managing bugs in a system. We dubbed it "bug tracker". When deciding on a framework we all decided on React as 3 out of 4 of us had previous experience in it. We also decided to use Firebase as our back end and hosting provider. Lastly we decided to use sematics UI to ease the usage of css. We decided to split the work up in half, front-end and back-end. I was the main person responsible for the front end of the site.

More details can be found in the README inside the "bug-tracker-master" folder.

The other members of this project was:
Lucas Larsson: Front-end
Dennis Hadzalic: Back-end
Alex Lindgren: Back-end

## What technologies were used?
React, Firebase, Javascript, CSS, Node, HTML, API

## What we’re the biggest challenges?
At first I found semantics UI to be quite confusing and challenging. I was quite used to using SASS during my previous projects. However after some time I quickly grew to find it relaxing and easy to use. 

However the largest challenge was connecting the front-end with the back-end. I have yet to work on a project so dependent on the back-end. This required a lot of collaboration and help from my team, some of which have worked within the back-end industry for a couple of years. 

## What did you learn from it?
I found this process to be very educational overall. Besides learning more about back-end in general by following the other teams progress I was also able to get more prevelant with npm packages, making me able to minimize the workload for future projects. On top of that I implemented new design features, such as modulas, content structure, just to name a few. I have already changed my personal website to make it more readable and usable, with plans to add other features in the future.
